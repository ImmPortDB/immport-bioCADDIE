The model classes included in this distribution represent a subset of the
classes of information available in the ImmPort model, only classes needed for
creating the DATS instances are represented. Also the classes in the ImmPort
model to support controlled vocabularies are not included, normally many of
the primary class columns would have foreign key references to the controlled
vocabulary classes.
